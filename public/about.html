<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Finance Major who got bored to death from his corporate finance internship.
  Thank God I was bored, because I finally found what I love to do, coding!
</p>

<p>
  Enjoys coding and solving new problems everyday. Loves to be stimulated by
  challenging projects. Am hoping to combine my passion for finance with my
  passion for computing.
